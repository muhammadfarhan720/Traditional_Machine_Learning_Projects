#Code Name and in short what it does

# Codes by Rubel

1. fft_eeg.py --> takes dataset and gives spectral power for all of the channel.
2. functions.py --> added information gain, decision tree classifer and MLP classifier code here.
		    Hyperparameter tuning code is also integrated in the same code. Same script 
		    ran for many cases by commenting out the portion was unnecessary based on requirment.
3. proj.py --> here called all 3 functions defined in the functions.py file to execute them.
4. merge_df.py --> this file merges different extracted data to make a combined one to run all the models.
